# Markdown Mathjax

## Syntax

In markdown you can actually use [[LaTeX]] Math equations. This is through a [[JavaScript]] Library called [MathJaX](https://www.mathjax.org/).

Mathjax is also similar to eqn in [Groff](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/DevLog/Notes/Groff).

The basic syntax of LaTeX Math is

`$inline equation$`

`$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$`

$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$

`$$Centered Equations$$`

`$$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$$`

$$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$$

as for the specifics of what equations you're putting into them that's up to you
