# Markdown Task List

Using the [[Markdown Lists|Lists]] feature, tasks are just an additional syntax on top of the list syntax

## Syntax

```
- [ ] an uncompleted task
- [x] a completed task
    - [ ] an indented uncompleted task
    - [x] an indented completed task    
```

In some processors completing the parent task to children tasks causes formatting such as strike through on sub items of the completed parent:

-   an `uncompleted` task
